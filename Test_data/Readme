This contains ps estimation from test data cube provided by SKA. The test image cube contains HI + noise. To compare the result, SKA office also provided only HI ps. We estimate the ps from image cube and compare that with SKA.
Note that our estimation has still small amount of noise bias and we have not done anything to correct that.
